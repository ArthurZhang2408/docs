# Mean Reciprocal Rank Reranker

The Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) Reranker is designed to optimize search result rankings by evaluating the average of the reciprocal ranks of results. This reranker is particularly useful for hybrid and multivector searches.

> **Note:** Supported query types include Hybrid Search and Multivector Search.

Accepted Arguments
----------------
| Argument | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `return_score` | str | `"relevance"` | Options are "relevance" or "all". The type of score to return. If "relevance", will return only the `_relevance_score`. If "all", will return all scores from the vector and FTS search along with the relevance score. |


## Supported Scores for each query type
You can specify the type of scores you want the reranker to return. The following are the supported scores for each query type:

### Hybrid Search
|`return_score`| Status | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `relevance` | ✅ Supported | Results only have the `_relevance_score` column. |
| `all` | ✅ Supported | Results have vector(`_distance`) and FTS(`score`) along with Hybrid Search score(`_distance`). |

### Multivector Search
|`return_score`| Status | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `relevance` | ✅ Supported | Results only have the `_relevance_score` column. |
| `all` | ✅ Supported | Results have vector(`_distance`) and FTS(`score`) along with Multivector Search score(`_distance`). |
