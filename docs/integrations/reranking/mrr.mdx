# Mean Reciprocal Rank Reranker

The Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) Reranker is used to combine and rerank search results from hybrid and multivector searches. It calculates the mean of the reciprocal ranks of the results, providing a single score that represents the overall ranking quality.

> **Note:** Supported query type – Hybrid search.
