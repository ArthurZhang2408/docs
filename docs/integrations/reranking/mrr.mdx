# Mean Reciprocal Rank Reranker

The Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) is a statistical measure used for evaluating any process that produces a list of possible responses to a sample of queries, ordered by probability of correctness. MRR is a popular metric in information retrieval and question answering systems.

## When to Use MRR vs RRF

MRR is particularly useful when you want to prioritize the highest-ranked relevant result, while RRF is better for combining rankings from multiple sources to improve overall result diversity.

## Configuring Weights

The `MRRReranker` allows you to configure the importance of vector search results versus FTS search results using the `weight_vector` and `weight_fts` parameters. Adjust these weights to balance the influence of each search type according to your needs.

Accepted Arguments
----------------
| Argument | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `weight_vector` | `float` | `0.5` | Weight for vector search results (0.0 to 1.0). |
| `weight_fts` | `float` | `0.5` | Weight for FTS search results (0.0 to 1.0). |
| `return_score` | `str` | `"relevance"` | Options are "relevance" or "all". The type of score to return. If "relevance", returns only the `_relevance_score`. If "all", returns all scores from vector and FTS search along with relevance score. |

## Supported Query Types

### Hybrid Search
|`return_score`| Status | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `relevance` | ✅ Supported | Returned rows only have the `_relevance_score` column. |
| `all` | ✅ Supported | Returned rows have vector(`_distance`) and FTS(`score`) along with Hybrid Search score(`_relevance_score`). |

### Multivector Search
|`return_score`| Status | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `relevance` | ✅ Supported | Returned rows only have the `_relevance_score` column. |
| `all` | ✅ Supported | Returned rows have vector(`_distance`) and FTS(`score`) along with Multivector Search score(`_relevance_score`). |
