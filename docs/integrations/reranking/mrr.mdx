# Mean Reciprocal Rank Reranker

The Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) reranker evaluates search results by averaging the reciprocal ranks of the first relevant result. It is particularly useful when the position of the first relevant result is of primary importance.

> **Note:** Supported query types – Hybrid and Multivector search.

Accepted Arguments
----------------
| Argument | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `weight_vector` | `float` | `0.5` | Weight for vector search results (0.0 to 1.0). |
| `weight_fts` | `float` | `0.5` | Weight for FTS search results (0.0 to 1.0). |
| `return_score` | `str` | "relevance" | Options are "relevance" or "all". Determines the type of score to return. |

## Supported Scores for each query type

### Hybrid Search
| `return_score` | Status | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `relevance` | ✅ Supported | Returned rows only have the `_relevance_score` column. |
| `all` | ✅ Supported | Returned rows have vector (`_distance`) and FTS (`score`) along with Hybrid Search score (`_relevance_score`). |

### Multivector Search
| `return_score` | Status | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `relevance` | ✅ Supported | Returned rows only have the `_relevance_score` column. |
| `all` | ✅ Supported | Returned rows have vector (`_distance`) and FTS (`score`) along with Multivector Search score (`_relevance_score`). |
