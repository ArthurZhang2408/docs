# Mean Reciprocal Rank Reranker

The Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) reranker evaluates search results based on the rank positions of relevant documents. It is particularly useful when the position of the first relevant result is critical.

## When to Use MRR vs RRF
- **MRR** is ideal when the focus is on the rank of the first relevant document.
- **RRF** is better when combining results from multiple sources with varying relevance.

## Accepted Arguments
| Argument | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `weight_vector` | `float` | `0.5` | Weight for vector search results (0.0 to 1.0). |
| `weight_fts` | `float` | `0.5` | Weight for FTS search results (0.0 to 1.0). |
| `return_score` | str | `"relevance"` | Options are "relevance" or "all". The type of score to return. If "relevance", returns only the `_relevance_score`. If "all", returns all scores from vector and FTS search along with relevance score. |

## Supported Scores for each query type
You can specify the type of scores you want the reranker to return. The following are the supported scores for each query type:

### Hybrid Search
|`return_score`| Status | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `relevance` | ✅ Supported | Results only have the `_relevance_score` column. |
| `all` | ✅ Supported | Results have vector(`_distance`) and FTS(`score`) along with Hybrid Search score(`_distance`). |

### Multivector Search
|`return_score`| Status | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `relevance` | ✅ Supported | Results only have the `_relevance_score` column. |
| `all` | ✅ Supported | Results have scores from multiple vector searches along with the `_relevance_score`. |
